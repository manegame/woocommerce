Enable WordPress to properly resize animated GIFs.

== Description ==

This small plugin enables WordPress to properly resize animated GIFs. On many installations, WordPress will resize animated GIFs by taking the first frame only. This plugin fixes this problem.

Thanks to Cl√©ment Guillemain for [GifCreator](https://github.com/Sybio/GifCreator) and [GifFrameExtractor](https://github.com/Sybio/GifFrameExtractor).

Note that this plugin can only resize animated GIFs at the moment. I will work on supporting rotations, reflections, etc when I have enough time.
