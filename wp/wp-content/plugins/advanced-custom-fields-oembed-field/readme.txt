Adds an oEmbed field type to Advanced Custom Fields.

== Description ==

Requires the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. Output can be selected as HTML embed, URL, or data object. Includes settings for preview and output resolution and will accept any provider registered in WordPress.

**With the news that ACF V5 includes a built-in oEmbed field type, we're discontinuing further development of this plugin. The plugin will remain online for legacy V4 support to those that havenâ€™t upgraded, but only essential updates will be released.**

= Compatibility =

This add-on will work with:

* Advanced Custom Fields version 4 and up
* Repeater Field

== Installation ==

This add-on can be treated as both a WP plugin and a theme include.

= Plugin =
1. Copy the 'acf-oembed' folder into your plugins folder
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins admin page

= Include =
1.	Copy the 'acf-oembed' folder into your theme folder (can use sub folders). You can place the folder anywhere inside the 'wp-content' directory
2.	Edit your functions.php file and add the code below (Make sure the path is correct to include the acf-oembed.php file)

`
add_action('acf/register_fields', 'my_register_fields');

function my_register_fields()
{
	include_once('acf-oembed/acf-oembed.php');
}
`
