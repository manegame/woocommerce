# ACF/Advanced Custom Fields oEmbed Field Type

Adds a 'oEmbed' field type for the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) WordPress plugin.

**With the news that ACF V5 includes a built-in oEmbed field type, we're discontinuing further development of this plugin. The plugin will remain online for legacy V4 support to those that havenâ€™t upgraded, but only essential updates will be released.**
